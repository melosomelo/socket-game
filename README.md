# Socket Game

This is a ping pong websocket game that I made in order to get more familiar with some tools and concepts.

## Motivations

I had some motivations coming into this project:

**I wanted to try out websockets**. So far, I had only tried HTTP-request-based backends and I knew that that wasn't all that was possible. When I found out that realtime communication is mostly made via websockets, I just knew I had to learn them.

**I wanted to start out with Typescript**. I know that Typescript is a deeply beloved language out there and I had heard all about its benefits in your code. So I knew that eventually I was going to try it out. Also, I was curious about how to integrate it with **React** and **Node**.

So, I create this project that combines these two objectives into one. It's a multiplayer, browser ping-pong game that uses webscokets and Typescript alongside React and Node.

## What I took from this experience

Nothing so far. I just started!

## Project's Mockups

Here are some screens of the game that I made on Figma:
