# Socket Game

This is a ping pong websocket game that I made in order to get more familiar with some tools and concepts.

The project is live in this URL: https://socket-game.vercel.app/

There may be some bugs that I'm still working to fix, but for the most part it's working!

## Motivations

I had some motivations coming into this project:

**I wanted to try out websockets**. So far, I had only tried HTTP-request-based backends and I knew that that wasn't all that was possible. When I found out that realtime communication is mostly made via websockets, I just knew I had to learn them.

**I wanted to start out with Typescript**. I know that Typescript is a deeply beloved language out there and I had heard all about its benefits in your code. So I knew that eventually I was going to try it out. Also, I was curious about how to integrate it with **React** and **Node**.

So, I create this project that combines these two objectives into one. It's a multiplayer, browser ping-pong game that uses webscokets and Typescript alongside React and Node.

## What I took from this experience

1. **I still need to learn a lot of Typescript**. In general, I thought that I got the "basics" of Typescript down, but there are a lot of advanced topics to study.

2. **I need to understand how configuring Typescript works**. Different enviroments require different configurations, and since this is my first project, I used some presets that I found online. I need to understand how to actually configure Typescript and its compiler.

3. **Webscokets are very straightforward**. I used the socketio library, and it's pretty easy to use and to get accustomed to. I'll definitely use it again.

4. **Typescript is really powerfull**. It just gives your code a whole new layer of security and quality. It gave me the hability of modeling my view of the problem more easily and securely.

## Project's Mockups
